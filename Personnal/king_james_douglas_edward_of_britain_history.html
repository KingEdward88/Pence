</p>
<a name="Influences" ><h2> Social Influences </h2></a>
<h4>Elementary School Influences</h4>
<p>Being cognitively advanced yet socially delayed in comparison to the other children his age, King James Douglas Edward of Britain, excelled in his studies while he was young yet found relationships to be difficult to form and manage; He was a hopeless romantic from even the youngest age and fondly recalls picnics with a beautiful kindergarten classmate with whom he shared his first kiss, but whose name has been lost to the ages.  King James Douglas Edward of Britain moved to Parkland Alberta soon after where he was introduced to a plethora of new students at Graminia Community School.  In his first year at the new school he met Tracy Meyer and fell instantly under her spell, he believed wholeheartedly that she would be his second kiss, and being proportionally superior to the other children and exhibiting a situational awareness that made King James Douglas Edward of Britain feel secure, Tracy, taught the young King to be respectfully confident and academically proud.  The King's desire for Tracy Meyer lasted until the fall of 1992 when he was introduced to the mysterious black haired seductress named Kerri-Ann Keneable, and soon after, the tenacious young Tamara Schultz. </p>
<p>Kerri-Ann was a quiet young woman who, either deliberately or not, did her best to remain in the eye of the King; Her subtle flirtatiousness infiltrated the young King's dreams and cemented his focus upon her for two years until he met Tamara Schultz in the fall of 1995.  
Tamara was a glowing, blonde, young woman with exceptionally strong Germanic accents;  She possessed the most welcoming expressions and although a relationship never formed between them her bubbly flirtatious attitude taught the young King to relax around women and trust himself. </p>

<p>In the summer of 1996, King James Douglas Edward of Britain learned from his parents that he would be moving to Mississauga Ontario to attend high school at St. Francis Xavier Secondary School; The King was shocked by the news and was unsure if he would ever find the same companionship he enjoyed at the country school of Parkland; Before his departure, the elementary school he attended threw a dance for the children; The King's mother refused to allow the young King to attend the dance due to his behavior the prior week in which he was sentenced to cleaning the school shed for his part in the dismemberment of a school tree. It would have been at this event that the King would have requested a dance with the influential and popular young woman named Nicole Donneley; To dance with Nicole was a decision the King had made once he realized that the young woman had always been present in his life: That somehow at every classroom party and gym class event, the young Nicole was always nearby. 
</p>
<h4>High School Influences</h4>
<p>In search of his ever elusive second kiss, King James Douglas Edward of Britain, in the fall of 1996, entered high school.  His first class was French, and it was taught by Mrs. Alley; King James Douglas Edward of Britain sat in the far back of the class behind two very influential young women, Marta and Adita, and beside what would become his first high school friend, Steven Stesky; Steven was a Ukranian dancer with high aspirations who appeared on the Electric Circus television dance show hosted by Much Music Television, in 1998;  Adita too appeared on an episode of the same show and Marta had a talent for photography. Due to all the new faces and cultures at his new school, King James Douglas Edward of Britain forgot much of what he had learned in elementary school and made no female friends until his second year of high school when he met Jeannan Karilah.  </p>
<p>Jeanan looked Egyptian, but was Lebanese by birth;  Her eyes were dark, like her black straight hair, and shaped like large almonds; They met after Steven Stesky made a deal with the King, he pomised to introduce the King to any girl that the King desired in the lunch room one day; The King pointed to Jeannan, who, with clips in her hair, "looked like a colorful butterfly."(1) As promised Steven introduced the pair and started what would be a royal infatuation which would last from the time they met in 1998 until the last time they spoke in 2001.  King James Douglas Edward of Britain never expressed his desire for her appropriately, before her, and as a result she never fully knew the way he felt about her. </p>

<p>DIC2A1 was a class which the King would never forget; It was in this grade 10 computer class that he would notice, but not speak to, Paulina Frackowiak; Paulina sat three rows directly across from the King and rarely made eye contact with him; She obeyed the instructor and worked diligently to finish her assignments while the King, distracted by the people around him, tried in secret to earn her attention.  It would not be until the fall of 1998 that the King would have the privilege of introducing himself to Paulina in the school lunch-room (around the time he was introduced to Jeannan).  Paulina was a silly woman who confused her logic for laughs, however, the King, being young, sought to belittle Paulina in a vain attempt at superiority; Their relationship culminated in a romantic arrangement where-by Paulina introduced the King to her friend <a href = "Agnes/Agnes.html">Agnes Biegus</a> in February of 2000.  </p>
<p>Agnes, like Paulina, was Polish and the King in many ways identified the two as one, and so, when Paulina introduced them, the King immediately fell in love.  Although details of their first date are scarcely known, the event took place on February 6, 2000 and involved dinner at Jack Astor's (a common restaurant for the King to bring a first date). His elusive third kiss was realized at the tender age of 17 when Agnes Biegus permitted his advancement at an all ages student music show held at the Hansa House in Mississauga Ontario; Agnes wore a white sleeveless ribbed turtleneck and King James Douglas Edward of Britain believed she was the embodiment of divine perfection.  The two dated exclusively for the remainder of their high school experience and in October of 2000, a week after the King turned 18, Agnes Biegus became King James Douglas Edward of Britain's first love; And although their relationship did not last, the time they spent together taught the King to be confident and proud, and led him to make advances towards other women at the time.  One such woman was Uzoma Ogbonna with whom he dated for a short period and remained friends with, long after high school ended.
</p>
<h4>University Influences</h4>
<p>University was a shock for King James Douglas Edward of Britain; This was none more evident than by his 1.28 cumulative GPA at the end of his first symmester; And although he spoke to many different people in this year, it was Andrew Shenouda who offered the King the greatest opportunity for personal growth; Andrew was a high school football player who was studying Aerospace engineering at Ryerson University along with the King; Like Paulina, he was diligent in his work but unlike her, he offered the King no romantic possibilities: Andrew was a prude; Their relationship was heated in the King's first year and both men's competitive nature was on display, however, Andrew showed a heightened situational awareness and superior self control; and soon, the King resorted to making new friends.</p> 
<p>In his first year at Ryerson the King met Angelina Pompei, a ravishing woman whom the King would desire for the remainder of his studies at Ryerson and beyond; Her hair was black silk and her eyes resembled those of Jeannan but presented a maturity of which only a college woman could possess; But, like Jeannan, the King was never able to express himself to her the way his imagination yearned; His first words to her were an insult, "I eat a lot" and his last were of goodbye; Angelina marked a regression in the King's social quotient which was worry-some for a short time, before he met Sandra Smith.  Sandra was a delayed student of Aerospace, at Ryerson, and they first met in Kamran Bhedinan's second year dynamics class, although each student was taking the class in the summer, for the King, it was his first try; Their relationship was a messy one of which the King regrets, but it taught him dignity and self respect, although in a forgettable manner.
</p>
<h4>Work Life Influences</h4>
<p>After graduation, in April of 2005, King James Douglas Edward of Britain worked for Ken Smyth at Phoenixaero Aviation Engineering head quartered first in Markham Ontario and then relocated to Mississauga Ontario;  While working for Phoenixaero the King experienced his first love triangle, between himself, Ryan Hader and the effervescent Cindy Ledger with whom the King learned patience, kindness and respect for life; The King’s first meet with Cindy was at the Ryerson Aerospace student union office after locking eyes on the street outside the building; It was on that day that the King learned of the romantic involvement between her and Ryan Hader, and that relationship loomed over them for the next three years until King James Douglas Edward of Britain moved to South Korea to start work as an English teacher in May of 2007. </p> 
<p>For two years the King taught middle school English and during that time he became very close with Sunny Kim a tall sultry private English teacher with whom the King was elated to know;  Their relationship ended quickly after only three months but the lasting impression Sunny made on the King will outlast even the oldest tales of his future accomplishments, for the King believes he treated Sunny Kim unjustly by being judgmental and inconsolable with the young sultress; Their relationship led the King to pursue the affections of the young Sulgi Choi, a theology student he met while studying for a TESOL at Chonbuk University in Jeonju Jeollabuk-do, Korea.  </p>
<p>The first thing the King noticed about Sulgi was her crystalline smile, and that smile has stayed with him in memory ever since.  Sulgi Choi introduced herself to the TESOL class as Sophia, and the King fell immediately in love; And if questioned, the King would say, "Sophia Choi was my wife for a day." Their relationship was unleveled near the end of 2009 when the King began having thoughts that Sophia was hiding her life from him; and coupled with his thoughts that he was superhuman, King James Douglas Edward of Britain began showing signs of a debilitating mental illness which the King associates with traumatic stress from his youth.  Although never married to the King, Sophia Choi taught the King that he could be a caring father, a loving husband and a supportive partner.
