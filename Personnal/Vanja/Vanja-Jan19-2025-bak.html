    <p> Dear Vanja,


Hello again my dear.  I have learned quite a bit about my place in the order of the royal monarchy of britain.  Currently I am still a prince because I have not been crowned, however, I am the Prince of Buckingham which means I will be king, but not until Charles dies or decides to pass it along; I'm hoping for the latter.  As for my past, I have pieced together information that may prove my real age.  When I was toddler my mother took me to the bank to purchase a 10 year savings bond; it matured in October of 2000.  That makes the year 1990 when I was a toddler.  The following year I was six years old and the date was 1989.  I know this because it was the year my grandfather died, and I have a record of that.  On my Canadian birth certificate it says I was born in 1982 which is impossible since I was a toddler in 1990.  Anyway, nobody is honest with me and I don't know who my parents are - that's my life in a nutshell.  I hope you are doing well and I hope to meet you someday.  Keep on modeling and keep your shirt on, I have big plans for you.


Sincerely, King Edward of Britain.</p>
