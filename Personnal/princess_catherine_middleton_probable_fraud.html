    <h1>Catherine Middleton's Possible Medical Fraud Charge!</h1>
    <p>September 10, 2024; By King James Douglas Edward of Britain</p>

    <p>Catherine Middleton, <a href=https://www.vogue.com/article/what-we-hope-kate-middleton-is-doing>pictured here by Vogue magazine</a> has made a claim that she, like her father in-law Charles III, has cancer;  This news came soon after the news of her mother in-law, Charles III wife, <a href=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/01/camilla-the-controversial-figure-who-may-become-queen> Camilla Rosemary Shand</a>, announced that she too was suffering from a possible terminal ilness;  However, unlike her inlaws, Catherine has admitted the path of treatment she will be receiving:  After her open cavity surgury in January, it was determined that she had cancer, and to combat this cancer she is being administered chemotherapy.</p>

    <p>Open cavity surguries, as well as chemotherapies, are regulated by the National Health Service of England (NHS England); So, there will be a record of both, as well as a record of the physicians who made diagnoses and operated on Catherine;  These records, like all medical records, are categorized by a Form number to simplify the storage and retreival of the document; The question is which form number is associatedwith open cavity surgeries, and which form number is associated with invasive treatments like Chemotherapy; The records may be closed to respect the privacy of the royal family, however, information about the involvement of the NHS, as well as the specific forms filed, will be available.  Where I live, the forms are unavailable to the general public, however advice on how to fillout the forms is publicly available;  The information booklet may be found here, <a href="/ahs-scn-sugrical-booking-form-reference-central.pdf" download>Form Outline</a>.</p>
    
    <p>It is my personal speculation that the current royal family is on a path to prevent their arrests by faking their deaths;  It began with Charles and Camilla faking ilnesses and now it has trickled down to the "apparent heirs" Catherine and maybe soon William;  In the end, if I can do nothing else, due to the current state of law in the UK, I will pursue the sentencing of William for his part in my abduction and attempted murder, for his purpose of claiming the throne of Britain.</p>
